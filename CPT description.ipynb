       "                       AAPC Coder Complete provides all the coding and reimbursement tools needed for inpatient coders, outpatient coders and CDI experts. Quickly view the OPPS fee schedules for freestanding ASCs and hospital based outpatient services in one place. For each CPT® code, you can identify the applicable modifiers, status indicators and payment indicators. For procedures that require devices, you can view if there is a credit adjustment policy for the device. Avoid bundling and determine proper modifier use by using the OPPS CCI checker for up to 25 codes at one time. The cross-reference tools allow you to forward and backward map CPT® to ICD-9-CM Volume 1 and 3, ICD-9-CM Volume 1 to ICD-10-CM and ICD-9-CM Volume 1 to the appropriate DRG options. Easily identity the DRG options, including CC and MCC, for each ICD-9-CM Volume 1 code.\n",
